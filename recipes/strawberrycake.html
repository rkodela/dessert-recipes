    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A simple cake that feels like it's made in heaven</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 (3 ounce) package strawberry flavored Jell-O®</li>
        <li>4 large eggs (room temperature)</li>
        <li>2 ¾ cups sifted cake flour</li>
        <li>2 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 cup whole milk, room temperature</li>
        <li>½ cup strawberry puree made from frozen sweetened strawberries</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.</li>
        <li>Beat sugar, butter, and dry strawberry gelatin together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.</li>
        <li>Combine flour and baking powder in a large bowl; stir into butter mixture alternately with milk. Blend in strawberry puree and vanilla. Divide batter evenly between the prepared pans.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 25 to 30 minutes. Cool cakes on a wire rack for 10 minutes; run a table knife around the edges to loosen. Invert carefully onto a serving plate or cooling rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
